Every year as the MLB trade deadline approaches losing teams exchange veterans with winning teams for prospects. The hope is that those prospects will turn around to become great major league baseball players. 

As much as major league teams would like minor leaguers to easily transition to the majors the process isn't easy and only 10% of prospects actually graduate to the major league. My goal is aid in the player selection process and build a model that takes minor league baseball statistics and predict whether or not a minor leaguer will actually "make it".
